# Simulation of two strings attached to a pendulum

This was one of my first programming projects. It is a simulation of a physical system containing two springs attached to a mass, which is itself holding a pendulum. The project is written in C, and the GUI was built using the GTK3+ C library.

## Prerequisites

To build the project, you need to install a **C compiler** and the **GTK3+ library**.
